About a dozen videos show people - many young men, but also at least two babies, a child, and a woman - being treated with oxygen masks in a medical facility. Many of the victims have their clothes [artially removed. Many patients are being treated on the floor of the medical facility because there are not enough beds. One victim appears to have pinpoint pupils and tremors in his fingers, both of which are symptoms of exposure to a nerve agent. Al Arabiya reported six people were killed and more than 70 were injured in the attack.\nFirst social media posts reporting the attack appeared around 11:00pm Syria time on 26 May 2013.",

    "summary_en": "Syrian government forces reportedly launched an attack with chlorine gas on Kafr Zita in Hama on 22 May 2014. A video shows a dense mustard-colored gas settled close to the ground on a street lined with small buildings, around dusk or dawn. Men wearing gas masks run towards the gas to assist people running away from the gas while covering their mouths. Additional videos show alleged victims of the attack, most of whom are women and children, receiving treatment in a crowded medical facility. Many patients are coughing and are treated with oxygen masks and IVs. A medical worker treating a small girl says in English that the patients were exposed to toxic chlorine, which was dropped in a bomb from a helicopter. The Hama Media Center reported 20 people were injured in the attack.\nThere were multiple reports of chemical weapon attacks on Kafr Zita in the days leading up to 22 May 2014.\nThe first reports of this chlorine attack appeared around 12:15pm Syria time on 22 May 2014. Given the timing of these reports and the lack of sunlight in the videos, the attack likely occurred around dawn, which was at 5:24am on 22 May 2014.",

Bombings in Bustan Al-Qasr started on December 8th, 2016. The victims of the bombardment in Bustan included children, women, and in general many were inncocent civillans.  The purpose of the attack by the Syrian government was try to take over Aleppo to gain territorial control back to the Syrian government. Acorrding to a report from the New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/middleeast/syria-aleppo-united-nations.html) , many had been imprisoned, tortured, and bodies lying on the street from constant bombardment by the regime. Furthermore, some of the innocent civillans throughout the conflict between the government and rebel forces had either reported that the rebels would prohibt civilains from leaving the city and some stated that they actually allowed civillians to flee. According to a report from the Gaurdian (https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/dec/13/eastern-aleppo-as-pro-assad-forces-move-in-in-pictures), they have documented multiple images of Syrians from Aleppo which includes the city of Bustan Al-Qasr, showing women and children fleeing from their homes due to constant clashes between the syrian and rebel forces. Thus, we can assume that the constant bombardment that was perputrated by the syrian regime has forced many to flee from their homes, displacing them and as to the reports that were mentioned, many innocent civillans were killed, imprisoned, tortured, etc. by the syrian forces.",

Many bodies filled the streets from constant bombardment in which the town was besiged making it difficult for inccocent villians to flee from bombs falling from russian and syrian helicopters. The victims of the masacre were inncocent people that ranged from children, the elderly, women, also rebel fighters. Footage of the massacre is provided by the White Helmets ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ghIjs2vFk0) as well as photograghs and more video footage by al jazeera (http://www.aljazeera.net/news/arabic/2016/12/12/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B5%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%AF%D9%85-%D8%A8%D8%AD%D9%84%D8%A8). The footage provided by the White helemts shows multiple bodies that are deaceased from shellings and with Al Jazerra's footage, many women were fleeing from Aleppo and the video captured the destruction caused by the shellings. Moreover, we can infer based on media collection of the massacre, video caught footage, and images of the destruction post-shelling that these attacks were allegedly perpeturated by the syrian regime and their allies which includes russia and hezzbollah.",

    "summary_en": "The city of Aleppo, Bustan Al-Qasr, there were reports of chemical weapons attack, the use of chlorine attacks allegdly by the Syrian government forces attacking the rebel-held areas. This took place on December 12th, 2016. According to a bellingcat report (https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2016/12/19/the-cl2-before-the-storm/) , they uploaded photos and sources from medical centers in the city of Bustan Al-Qasr called, Bustan Al-Qsar Medical Center. They reported from those medical centers that many inoccent had been targeted; children, women, and genreally inncocent cilvillans in the city. The weapon as described by the bellingcat report and from a report from the Human Rights Watch (https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/02/13/syria-coordinated-chemical-attacks-aleppo) , the chlorine attack was dropped by gas cylinders filled with chlorine dropped from a helipcopter. The reports as mentioned, provided pictures of the children who were attacked, videos of the chemical weapons being dropped from helicopters and their aftermath of the bombs being dropped. Moreover, we can infer that these attacks were perputrated by the Syrian government in the previously rebel-held area of Bustan Al-Qsar which has injured and killed numerous inncocent civillains.",

    "summary_en": "On December 12th, 2016 a neighborhood in East Hama, Uqayribat, the district was attacked with chemical weapons that were dropped by war planes. According to the Human Rights Watch report (https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/05/01/death-chemicals/syrian-governments-widespread-and-systematic-use-chemical-weapons), they recieved information from the locals of the neighboorhood reporting that there were war planes dropping the chemical weapons and that ot was done by the syrian and russian regime. This neighboorhood had a strong ISIS hold as well so many of the locals stated that they weren't allowed to document the chemical attacks because of fear from the Islamic State. According to Al Arabi's report (https://www.alaraby.co.uk/politics/2016/12/12/%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%88%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A8%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%82%D9%8A) they reported that many civillians in neighborhoods of East Hama suffucated because of the chemical weapons which were linked to be Sarin gas according to the media report. Going back to the Human Rights Watch report, 67 locals died from the chemical attacks and these were noted by medical charity workers on the ground, on ground activists, etc. Furthermore, reports by the Human rights watch and well established media reports collected on the chemical attack in Eastern Hama conclude that the attacks were allgedly done by the syrian and russian regime in order to combat the Islamic State that has a strong hold in eastern Hama even though many pf the attacks had harmed numerous innocent civillians.",
