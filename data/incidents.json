    "summary_en": "Syrian government forces reportedly attacked Adra, Damascus with weapons containing chemical agents. Medical workers clad in protective gas masks and gowns treated patients in medical facility in nearby Douma, Damascus. Many patients were treated with oxygen masks and displayed difficulty breathing. Many patients had their clothes partially removed, and some were washed down with water. A few patients displayed pinpoint pupils, which is a symptom consistent with exposure to a nerve agent. Another patient was foaming at the mouth, which is also consistent with exposure to a nerve agent. A few patients appear to have mild traumatic injuries but most appear to be suffering from non-trauma related injuries. The medical facility is overwhelmed with patients and treating victims on the floor. All patients seen in vidoes are young men.\nFirst social media posts reporting the incident were posted late at night on 23 May 2013, thus incident likely happened earlier that evening or night.",

    "summary_en": "According to the White Helmets twitter page (@SyriaCivilDef) there were reports of a chemical attack in Jabal Zawiya, Idlib at 22:00 on 26 April 2015. Barrel bombs were used to drop the toxic substances (allegedly chlorine). The channel عبدالله جدعان on Youtube posted many videos presumably of the aftermath of the attacks. ٍٍReports claim that 9 were found dead as a result of the attack, of which 4 were children. Several videos show buildings in ruins and bulldozers cleaning up. Witnesses recall seeing planes drop the barrel bombs, which contained the toxic substances. Another video shows what may be a funeral procession the day after the attack, with a group of men carrying two bodies.",

The camera then flashes to outside the building where it appears to be sunset. It then flashes to chemical remains from a chemical attack. The news presenter then interviews medical staff or personell in the hospital. The camera then shoots to the outside and a young boy is holding his nose and gesturing to something that the camera does not point to. The video is captured by Orient news. The other video begins by facing the bottom corner of a wall which appears to have been destroyed as there is a hole. The camera then shoots to a medical personnell sitting at a desk talking to the camera. The camera then goes to the outside of the room where the hole is much larger and a man points to it describing what has happened.",

Bombings in Bustan Al-Qasr started on December 8th, 2016. The victims of the bombardment in Bustan included children, women, and in general many were inncocent civillans.  The purpose of the attack by the Syrian government was try to take over Aleppo to gain territorial control back to the Syrian government. Acorrding to a report from the New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/middleeast/syria-aleppo-united-nations.html) , many had been imprisoned, tortured, and bodies lying on the street from constant bombardment by the regime. Furthermore, some of the innocent civillans throughout the conflict between the government and rebel forces had either reported that the rebels would prohibt civilains from leaving the city and some stated that they actually allowed civillians to flee. According to a report from the Gaurdian (https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/dec/13/eastern-aleppo-as-pro-assad-forces-move-in-in-pictures), they have documented multiple images of Syrians from Aleppo which includes the city of Bustan Al-Qasr, showing women and children fleeing from their homes due to constant clashes between the syrian and rebel forces. Thus, we can assume that the constant bombardment that was perputrated by the syrian regime has forced many to flee from their homes, displacing them and as to the reports that were mentioned, many innocent civillans were killed, imprisoned, tortured, etc. by the syrian forces.",

    "summary_en": "The city of Aleppo, Bustan Al-Qasr, there were reports of chemical weapons attack, the use of chlorine attacks allegdly by the Syrian government forces attacking the rebel-held areas. This took place on December 12th, 2016. According to a bellingcat report (https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2016/12/19/the-cl2-before-the-storm/) , they uploaded photos and sources from medical centers in the city of Bustan Al-Qasr called, Bustan Al-Qsar Medical Center. They reported from those medical centers that many inoccent had been targeted; children, women, and genreally inncocent cilvillans in the city. The weapon as described by the bellingcat report and from a report from the Human Rights Watch (https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/02/13/syria-coordinated-chemical-attacks-aleppo) , the chlorine attack was dropped by gas cylinders filled with chlorine dropped from a helipcopter. The reports as mentioned, provided pictures of the children who were attacked, videos of the chemical weapons being dropped from helicopters and their aftermath of the bombs being dropped. Moreover, we can infer that these attacks were perputrated by the Syrian government in the previously rebel-held area of Bustan Al-Qsar which has injured and killed numerous inncocent civillains.",
