    "summary_en": "Syrian government airstrike on Kafr Takharim and/or Salqin (they're neighboring villages) contained some sort of toxic substance, possibly arsenic (according to https://twitter.com/jwana_18/status/257176505036193795). Substance dropped was soft and light like cotton or spiderwebs. In one video, white material can be seen in a tree (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foe2Fj9UiBI). Another video shows announcements on minarets warning residents not to touch the white substance in the streets (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udLJoNt4X38&feature=youtu.be). Two videos show a helicopter flying, but it's unclear if this was the aircraft that carried out the CW attack (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYPOaBw_xHs and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xixtMYaR_WQ). One video shows a weapon close up, but it's unclear whether it's related to the incident (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lApYCaDXZZI). \nBased on time of social media posts, date of attack was Oct 13, 2012. The first post about the incident was around 15:30 (Syria time) on Oct 13. \nReports say the attack was on both Kafr Takharim and Salqin, and videos appear to come from both towns. Location is entered as Kafr Takharim, but this may have occured in Salqin or in between the towns.",

Their symptoms (evidently choking and difficulty breathing) may be more consistent with exposure to a choking agent. Eight other videos show close-ups of individuals who allegedly were killed in the attack, by exposure to the chemical weapon.\nSources on twitter reported the attack was in al Khalidiya and al Bayada - two neighborhoods right next to each other in Homs, thus it's unclear exactly where the attack happened.\nFirst tweets posted around 20:45 Syria time on 23 Dec 2012.",

    "summary_en": "Medical workers, most wearing protective gas masks and some wearing gowns, treat patients in medical facility. Many patients are wearing oxygen masks and have clothes partially removed, which is consistent with treatment for exposure to a chemical agent. A few patients have pinpoint pupils, which is a symptom consistent with exposure to a nerve agent. Another patient is foaming at the mouth, which is also consistent with exposure to a nerve agent. One patient, who appears only mildly responsive, is given a shot in his left arm. A couple other patients are hosed down or doused with water, which is a common practice when treating somone for exposure to a chemical agent. A few patients appear to have mild traumatic injuries (i.e. are cut and bleeding), but most appear to be suffering from non-trauma related injuries and are experiencing difficulty breathing, which is also consistent with exposure to a chemical agent. Medical facility appears to be overwhelmed with patients and has people lying on the floor to receive treatment. All patients appear to be young men.\nAccording to video titles, patients all came from a chemical weapon attack in Adra, and many were transported to Douma to recieve medical care. \nFirst video was posted at 23:48 on May 23, thus incident likely happened sometime in the evening or night of May 23.",

Although there weren’t many videos available, the channel عبدالله جدعان posted many videos presumably of the aftermath of the attacks. ٍٍReports claim that 9 were found dead as a result of the attack, of which 4 were children. Several videos show buildings in ruins and bulldozers cleaning up. Witnesses recall seeing planes drop the barrel bombs, which contained the toxic substances.

That corroborates with facebook posts and an article from Syrian news desk. There were no videos found to corroborate information. In addition, some tweets as well as the article from Syrian news desk mention attacks on other villages in the area like Al-Hawash. (see incident HAW290415)",
